# A Discord Bot using Discord.JS Master branch

## Information
Its been a while since i wrote this, i wanted to make a bot with slash commands (which at the time were very new) and that used redis for caching data. this is my experimental project that even encrypted data to make it more secure.

## Features

- Redis data caching with TTL
- Data encryption using AES-256-CBC
- Advanced Interaction Support

## Redis Caching

This bot uses Redis to cache data such as users, guilds, channels, messages, roles, emojis, etc.

Cached data also has an expire time of 30 days (The maximum amount of time allowed per the Discord Developer Agreement) after which the data is deleted.

## Data Encryption

All data stored whether it be cache or configs, is encrypted using AES-256-CBC encryption.

## Advanced Interaction Support

This bot comes packed with Hybrid Commandsâ„¢ which can allow a command to be a regular command and an slash command. (Edit: because of how new slash commands were, this was my way of making them work)

Interaction commands also have an option for the reply be ephemeral!
